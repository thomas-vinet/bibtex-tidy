## Current state of modifications

- Added the logic the read the config file, and a yaml, bib file to test 

## TODO 

- Remove the test files

- Split the logic to keep a sync behaviour, but have an async function reading the config file, and a sync function just looking at the config

- Have a merge function between two configs so that it can be tested

- Try to type the function in optionUtils.ts
